# 🙌 Gesture Machine: Mediapipe + Voice-Controlled Python Assistant

Originally inspired by JARVIS from the Iron Man movies, this project has evolved into a powerful accessibility tool. Rather than being a general AI, Gesture Machine is designed to assist individuals who have difficulty typing—such as those with trigger finger or carpal tunnel syndrome—by interpreting predefined hand signs and voice commands to perform everyday computer tasks.

## 🧠 Features

- 🎯 **Special Command Recognition**  
  Detects specific hand gestures that trigger keyboard actions such as **Enter**, **Open Spotify**, and **Volume Up/Down**.

- 🧑‍💻 **User-Friendly Python Implementation**  
  Clean and readable code structure using standard Python libraries.

- 🧊 **Cooldown Mechanism**  
  Prevents accidental multiple key presses from repeated detection, ensuring smooth user experience.

- 📺 **Real-Time Visual Feedback**  
  Terminal-based debug output to track gesture recognition and system behavior.

- 🎙️ **Voice Recognition**  
  Supports voice-based **typing** and **clicking**, allowing hands-free interaction with the screen.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Python 3.x** – Main programming language.  
- **SpeechRecognition** – Captures and converts audio to actionable text commands.  
- **OpenCV** – Handles video capture, processing, and gesture detection.  
- **PyAutoGUI** – Simulates mouse clicks and keyboard presses for automation.  
- **Pytesseract (Tesseract OCR)** – Recognizes text on the screen for click-targeting based on spoken words.  
- **OS** – Used to launch desktop apps like Spotify.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- 🔤 Expand the gesture vocabulary (e.g., full ASL alphabet or more commands).
- 🧩 Add custom hand signs for launching applications or macros.
- 🔊 Implement voice feedback or text-to-speech for improved accessibility.
- 📱 Optimize the system for mobile or low-power embedded devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
